# Domoticz-Toyota-Plugin 0.9.3
[![PyPI pyversions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue.svg)]() [![Plugin version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.9.3-red.svg)](https://github.com/joro75/Domoticz-Toyota-Plugin/branches)

A [Domoticz][domoticz] plugin that provides devices for a [Toyota][toyota] car with connected services.

Be aware that since version 0.9.3 also an update of [mytoyota][mytoyota] to version 0.9.3 is required, so ensure that
also the [mytoyota][mytoyota] Python module is updated!

This plugin is using the same API that is used by the Toyota MyT connected services
app. This API is however only useable for cars that are purchased in Europe.
For more information on Toyota MyT see the [Austrian][MyT_Austrian],
[Belgian][MyT_Belgian], [British][MyT_British], [Danish][MyT_Danish],
[Dutch][MyT_Dutch], [European][MyT_European], [French][MyT_French],
[German][MyT_German], [Italian][MyT_Italian], [Spanish][MyT_Spanish] or
[Swiss][MyT_Swiss] website.

The Toyota car should first be made available in the MyT connected services
app, after which this plugin can retrieve the information, which is then provided as several
devices in Domoticz.

## State and development
The current version is working for my situation, and a few others. It will be impossible for me to test the plugin with every Toyota car model
as there is a large variation in the provided data for each Toyota car and they also can have own specific options. However most of the functionality should
be working. The number of provided devices is not complete yet, and future updates will add additional devices.

This plugin is using pre-commit. If you would like to contribute an improvement, fork this repository and
create a new branch, which includes the improvements. Before making a PR, please run `pre-commit run --all-files`
and make sure that all tests are passing before requesting the PR.
